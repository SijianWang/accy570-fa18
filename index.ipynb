    "## Course Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completion of this course, students will be expected to understand the basic concepts of data science. Students will learn how to work at a Unix prompt, how to use the Python programming language to process, visualize, and analyze large data sets, how to work with relational databases, and how to perform basic data analytics by using Python.\n",

    "### Lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "We have reserved the Deloitte Auditorium from 8-9:20 am on Monday and Wednesday every week; however, there will nominally only be one lecture time used each week. Any changes to the lecture schedule will be shared via the course [Announcement forum][af]. The midterm examination will use one for a lecture period for this course.  The following table summarizes the planned lecture dates and topics.\n",

    "\n",
    "You have been assigned to a specific discussion section. Due to the high enrollment for this course, you must only attend your assigned discussion section. Discussion sections normally only meet once a week, except for the two weeks where your group will present your group project (this means you must keep both assigned date/times free in your schedule). Both discussion sections will be used for group project presentations. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no pre-requisites for this course, except for an interest in learning the basic skills necessary for being a data scientist and access to a computer to participate in the course lectures, and to complete the required course assignments, mini-projects, and group project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: At present, we are using Amazon Web Service cloud computing system to run a course JupyterHub server. Each student is running a Dockerized version of the course software stack. This provides many advantages including robustness against crashes, simplicity of deploying software updates, reduced requirements for students (simply a modern web browser, we have used tablets and smart phones), and simplifying assignment and mini-project submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each module there will be an `index.ipynb` Jupyter notebook in each Module that is linked from the course Moodle site that will give you access to the different course notebooks for that week, please use these on the course server to move through the course material.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Texts\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no required textbooks for this course. Instead, we will utilize Internet accessible websites, videos, and documentation as supplemental material to the lesson content. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Academic Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "Academic honesty is essential to this course and the University. Any instance of academic dishonesty (including but not limited to cheating, plagiarism, falsification of data, and alteration of grades) will be documented in the student's academic file. In addition, **at a minimum** the particular assessment, quiz, assignment, group project, or examination will be given a zero. Serious or repeated offenses may be punished more severely.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Guidelines for collaborative work**: Discussing course material with your classmates is in general a good idea, but each student is expected to do his or her own work. On assignments, you may discuss the problems and concepts behind them, but you are responsible for your own answers. Please do not post code in the forums (or any other public website)! Finally, on examinations and quizzes, your answers must of course be your own. For further info, see the [Student Code, Part 4. Academic Integrity](http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-401.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Automatic Plagiarism Detection**\n",
    "This semester we may employ an automatic plagiarism detection tool on each assignment. This tool easily identifies submissions that are more similar than would be randomly expected. When this tool is run, the instructional staff will review the output from this tool, and, as necessary, formally identify students who we believe are guilty of cheating. At a minimum, the following policy will be enforced:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **First** Offense: Warning.\n",
    "- **Second** Offense: Zero on affected assignment.\n",
    "- **Third** Offense: Final grade reduced by one letter grade and a notification sent to home unit.\n",
    "- **Fourth** Offense: Automatic **F** in course and a notification sent to the Dean of Students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, each argument about the enforcement of this policy that is deemed frivolous by the instructional staff may result in ten percent reduction in the affected assignment score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "The instructional staff will use the [Announcement Forum][af] on the course Moodle to communicate important course information. Do not unsubscribe from this forum or you risk missing important news!\n",
    "\n",
    "The preferred method for student communication in this course is to use the [Q&A Forum][qaf] on the course Moodle. The instructional staff monitors this forum and will respond in less than 24 hours (in general we will respond even faster than this, especially during normal business hours). Furthermore, your fellow students may be able to help even faster. We also encourage you to search this forum prior to making a new post since your question may have already been answered.  You can search a forum on Moodle by using the __Search forums__ tool that is located on the upper right corner of any Moodle forum.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a question (that is not answered in this syllabus nor on the online course forums) you can email the instructional staff, however, this should be a last resort. If we feel the question is best answered on the [Q&A Forum][qaf], we reserve the right to post your question and our answer on Moodle. Also, note the information contained in the __Point Reductions__ section of this syllabus. \n",

    "## Weekly Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Each week will contain one or two modules, which will each provide learning objectives and an outline of the activities for that week with a list of all deadlines and corresponding point values for assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Videos\n",
    "\n",
    "Each week there will be one instructor created overview video that will offer a broader context for the new week, explain key concepts, and demonstrate important tasks. In addition, there will be per-lesson videos that go into more depth on the readings and notebooks associated with each lesson. These videos will be linked from the relevant course module or lesson overview notebook on the JupyterHub server. \n",
    "\n",
    "To view the instructor videos, you will need to login to the Illinois Mediaspace. You will not be directly graded for watching the videos; however, we strongly encourage you to watch them as they contain information and demonstrations that will prove helpful as you work through each week's lessons. Note that information presented in course videos may be relevant for quizzes and assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Readings\n",
    "\n",
    "Readings will consist of articles and excerpts from books and websites, internet-accessible videos demonstrating a concept, and, in some cases, Jupyter notebooks that can be viewed by interacting with them via the course JupyterHub server. You will be required to read and be familiar with the content of these documents. Readings are contextualized as part of the weekly lesson content and are located in the \"Readings\" section of each lesson. For those wishing to obtain a deeper understanding, we also present optional readings that provide additional information that is not required for either course quizzes or assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lessons \n",
    "\n",
    "Lessons will expand upon, or clarify key concepts in the reading assignments or supplement or add to the reading. All lessons for a given week should be completed by 6:00 PM Central Time on Thursday of the relevant week.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "Every module contains an assignment that will involve one or more computational tasks related to the focus for that given module. Your submitted assignments will be collected automatically at the deadline from the course JupyterHub server. These assignments will be automatically graded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, this year we have two assignments per module, a **low** and a **high** assignment. Both must be completed each week. While you may do them in either order, the **low** assignment is generally easier. The **low** assignment will count for 25\\% of your module assignment grade, and the **high** assignment will count for 75\\% of your module assignment grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, assignments will be automatically collected from your individual server repository at the deadline. Do not wait until the last minute to start an assignment, the server may become slower than normal when under heavy load. In addition, please be sure to **Restart Kernel and Run All Cells** in your assignment notebooks prior to completion. Students have lost points in the past for failing to follow this simple instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Group Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "You will work in a group on one large data analytics task, which is broken into two group projects. The groups will be assigned by the instructional staff via the course Moodle site and the assigned group project will contain full details of the task. The first group project will be detailed during week two of the course, while the second group project will be detailed during week nine. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each group project, you will turn in a check-in notebook roughly two weeks after the project is released (so in week 4 and in week 11). Your initial group check-in notebook will be graded out of 50 points. You will also turn in a final project notebook in week seven and week fourteen. Your final submitted notebook will be graded out of 450 total points. You also will do a group project presentation after the notebook has been submitted. The in-class presentation will be worth a maximum of 300 points, creativity will be rewarded! Finally, you will review your fellow group-mates for a maximum of 100 points for each group project, after the presentations are completed by filling in an online survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, each group project you do in this course is worth a total of 900 points. There are two group projects, your group will stay the same for both, giving a total of 1800 points for the group project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weekly Quizzes\n",
    "\n",
    "Each week will conclude with a weekly quiz. The weekly quiz is designed to test your overall mastery of the content for each given week. Weekly quizzes will be **timed** and **only allow one attempt**. The quiz must be completed by 6:00 PM Central Time on Friday of that week.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exams \n",
    "\n",
    "This course will have both a midterm examination and a final examination. while each examination will focus on eight modules, the final examination is, by the nature of this course, comprehensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Server Maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "While we do not expect server issues, we do need time every week for migrating new content to the course server, and to fix issues that might arise. To minimize disruptions to the class, we reserve Monday mornings 9:30 am - 12:00 pm for server maintenance. An announcement will be made when the server is operational and ready for you to resume working. We do not expect to need all of this time every week. However, do not try to reconnect to the server until receiving the announcement or you risk losing work. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Grading Scale \n",
    "\n",
    "Final grades will be graded on a curve, if necessary. Note, Professor Brunner will be the sole determiner on whether a curve will be used and, if so, how ti will be computed. The letter grade cutoffs will be set at the traditional 90%, 80%, and 70% limits, and plus/minus will be added if you are within two points of the traditional cutoffs (so 100–98 is an A+ and 90–92 is an A-).\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: There will be no **Rounding-up** in this course. Your point total at the end of the semester, after any curve is applied, will be mapped onto the following grade breakdown and that will be your final grade. Do not contact the instructor after the fact and request a round-up.\n",

    "### Point Reductions ###\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a large, primarily online course, so we expect that students read the syllabus and search online forums before either emailing us directly or posting a new question in the Moodle forums. Failure to abide by this request may, at the sole discretion of the instructional staff, result in a loss of five points per **obvious** infraction. Please note that we are not trying to stifle questions (such as why is some server down?). We simply need to minimize the number of such emails/questions we receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extra Credit ###\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not envision any opportunities for _extra credit_ at this time.\n",
